Repository which contains code for my C++ learning experience. Will contain very basic programs and document the learning process.

Tracking:

Day 1: 
Downloaded and installed C++.
Linked all to GitHub.
Learnt how to commit and push through git bash
Added .gitignore and readme through gitbash
wrote basic helloworld program in C++
Difference between compiled language and interpreted language:
	interpreter (R, Python) takes each line of code, translates to machine code, delivers output (pretty slow)
	compiler (C, C#, C++) takes all code at once, translates and gives back to user (much faster)
	
Day 2:
Namepsaces, aliases - create additional name for data type, basic arithmetic

Day 3-10:
If statements, for loops, small programs, do while, random numbers, return, functions, knowledge on program execution, and frequent learning about pointers and memory management
